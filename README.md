This web application is called IT Equipment Management System (I.T.E.M.S.). 

# Overview
It allows for the recordkeeping and tracking of IT Hardware equipment for a company.
It allows employees to submit requests to the IT department for equipment.
The system is designed for two roles, IT Administrator and Employee, however, no role restriction is implemented in this release.

# Tools and technologies
The application is developed with the following technologies:
- Node JS
- ExpressJS
- MongoDB
- Mongoose

# Running project
Clone repository locally, and run command npm install to add node modules to the project.
Run node server.js and navigate to localhost:3000

# Release Notes
Functionality developed includes entering, updating and deleting inventory data, and entering and viewing IT requests.
Implemented REST - Accessible by inventory/format/:format or requests/format/:format. data is returned in appropriate format, but does not consistently render in readable view (possibly due to browser behavior)
Inventory and Request view pages - Need to click down a little hard on the table icon links
Included NodeJS modules - Referenced from METCS602 Assignments source/submission: Bachoti, Praveen. CS602_HW3_Bachoti. METCS601. Boston University, 15 August, 2022.
